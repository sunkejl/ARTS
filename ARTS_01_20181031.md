## Problems 1 [two-sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,

return [0, 1].



```
/**
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
 */
int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target) {
    int* res = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*2);
    for(int i=0;i<numsSize-1;i++){
        for(int j=i+1;j<=numsSize-1;j++){
            if((nums[i]+nums[j])==target){
                res[0]=i;
                res[1]=j;
                return res;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

>Section 1.1  Information Is Bits + Context
Our hello program begins life as a source program (or source ﬁle) that the programmer creates with an editor and saves in a text ﬁle called hello.c. 
The source program is a sequence of bits, each with a value of 0 or 1, organized in 8-bit chunks called bytes. 
Each byte represents some text character in the program. 
Most modern systems represent text characters using the ASCII standard that represents each character with a unique byte-sized integer value. 
The hello.c program is stored in a ﬁle as a sequence of bytes. Each byte has an integer value that corresponds to some character. 
For example, the ﬁrst byte has the integer value 35, which corresponds to the character ‘#’. 
The second byte has the integer value 105,which corresponds to the character‘i’,and soon.
Notice that each text line is terminated by the invisible newline character ‘\n’, which is represented by the integer value 10.
Files such as hello.c that consist exclusively of ASCII characters are known as text ﬁles. 
All other ﬁles are known as binary ﬁles. 
There present ation of hello.c illustrates a fundamental idea:All information in a system—including disk ﬁles,
programs stored in memory, 
user data stored in memory,
and data transferred across a network is represented as a bunch of bits. 
The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in which we view them. 
For example, in different contexts, the same sequence of bytes might represent an integer, ﬂoating-point number, character string, or machine instruction. 
As programmers,we need to understand machine represent ations of numbers because they are not the same as integers and real numbers. 
They are ﬁnite approximations that can behave in unexpected ways.

tip of use git --amend and  git rebase
rebase的原理,rebase和merge区别，以及在什么情况下使用rebase或者merge
rebase:拉去远程分支，把本地分支的每次提交记录和远程分支的进行合并，提交后，时间线就会成为一条直线，不会有分叉
rebase用于本地分支
merge用于远程分支
